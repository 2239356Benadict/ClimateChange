# Clean Island

 MSc VR group assignment for developing a VR application around the concept of "Climate Change".
 
### **Description**
<p align="justify">
Waste management is important as it saves the environment from the toxic effects of inorganic and biodegradable element present in waste. Mismanagement of waste can cause water contamination, soil erosion and air contamination. Waste can be recycled if collected and managed efficiently.

<p align="justify">
Clean Island is a VR application that aims to educate people on the importance of cleaning the environment. The user has the choice to collect the waste or not and can walk around the environment to collect the waste and put it into the respective waste bin. Three scenarios will be displayed at the end of the application based on the quantity of garbage gathered.

The user must place the rubbish into the bin after picking it. Once it is placed in the trash bin, each piece of waste will be counted. The bin's lid can be opened much like in the real world.

##### **Collection Status**
